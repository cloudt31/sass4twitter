On Target Ansible Server:
1. Change /etc/ssh/sshd_config to enable password authentication.
2. Restart SSH Services: systemctl restart sshd.
3. Reset user[ubuntu] password and keep that password for safekeeping.

On Primary Ansible Server:
1. Go to user's home directory [/home/ubuntu]
2. Execute:
ssh-keygen -t rsa -f /home/ubuntu/.ssh/ansible.key
ssh-keygen -R <Second Server's IP Address>
chmod 666 ansible.key
ssh-copy-id -i /home/ubuntu/.ssh/ansible.key.pub ubuntu@<Second Server's IP Address>
3. Ansible configurations:
sudo nano /etc/ansible/hosts
# Include second server's configuration:
[exampleserver]
<IP of 2nd Server>

[exampleserver:vars]
ansible_password=<Password obtained for user on Target Ansible Server[Point 3]>
4. Check whether everything has worked out fine:
ansible all -m ping
# It should return something like:
ubuntu@r-pz3h7ig2-0:~/.ssh$ ansible all -m ping
<Second Server's IP Address> | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false, 
    "ping": "pong"
}

All files in the enlisted folders of Harvester and DBServer have to be added in the primary server's /home/ubuntu directory
